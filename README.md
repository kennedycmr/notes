# Overview

This repository holds technical documentation that I feel is useful. 

* The documentation is compiled into a static site, via mkdocs.
* The site is designed to be hosted from a GCS bucket, though it could be deployed in a number of other methods.


## How to deploy

1. cd to $REPO_ROOT
1. run command `mkdocs build`. A directory called "site" will be created. 
1. all the files found in $REPO_ROOT/site should be uploaded to the GCS bucket.
